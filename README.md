# 🛒 Shopping Cart System (C++)
A robust command-line application that manages a virtual inventory, demonstrating core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and efficient data management.
# 🏆 Project Context
This software was developed while studying Computer Science at UPRM. The logic and algorithmic efficiency applied here are consistent with the skills that earned me 3rd Place in the ACM-CS Programming Competition 2025-2026.
## 🚀 Technical Highlights
* **OOP Architecture:** Designed with modular classes (`ItemToPurchase` and `ShoppingCart`) to ensure encapsulation and clean code structure.
* **Dynamic Data Handling:** Implemented `std::vector` for real-time inventory management, allowing for dynamic addition and removal of items.
* **CRUD Logic:** Full support for Creating, Reading, Updating (prices/quantities), and Deleting items by searching through dynamic arrays.
* **Automated Accounting:** Calculates individual item sub-totals and the grand total for the entire cart automatically.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
* **Language:** C++.
* **Memory Management:** Efficient use of dynamic storage.
* **Version Control:** Managed via Git/GitHub.
